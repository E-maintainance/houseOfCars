               <h1>Breaks Service</h1>
               <h2>COMPREHENSIVE BRAKE CARE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>
               <p>Your brakes are one of your vehicle’s biggest safety components. They allow you to halt the forward momentum of your car or truck quickly and effectively, ensuring that no matter where you go, you can stop at traffic lights and round corners with ease, all without slamming into the vehicle in front of you. .</p>
               <h2>How We Can Help</h2>
               <p>As your partners in automotive care, we service your brakes as thoroughly as possible, conducting a full inspection before determining and fixing the problem.</p>
                <p>When servicing your vehicle, we always provide you an upfront summary of everything that needs to be fixed, including a parts and labor cost-breakdown. </p>
                   <p> Your vehicle repairs are always your choice, and we will never do anything without your consent.</p>

                <section id="sec2">
                <p>Typically brake problems stem from worn brake pads or rotors. When you stop, your brake pads create friction to help slow your vehicle,<br> while your rotors disperse heat to prevent your brakes from overheating. Both pieces are essential when it comes to functioning brakes. Fortunately,<br> if either of these pieces are damaged, we can replace them.<br></p>
                    <p>You may also be experiencing brake problems because of low brake fluid. <br> This fluid is responsible for turning the force you add to your braking system by pushing the pedal into amplified pressure that will actually slow or stop your vehicle. <br> It also protects the internal metal components of your brakes from corrosion.</p>
                    <p>However, the most important benefit we offer our customers is our partnership. We treat each vehicle we see like it’s our own, and truly become your partner in automotive care. <br> Our guests are informed of the repair process every step of the way with thorough and transparent explanations from our Service Team.</p>

                        <h3>Driving Habits and Preventative Maintenance</h3>
                        <p>You can extend the life of your brakes–including pads and rotors–through regular maintenance and by adjusting your driving habits. Be sure to service your brakes as soon as you experience any symptoms and replace your brake fluid as recommended by your vehicle’s manufacturer. Reduce wear and tear by avoiding stop and go traffic and minimizing your vehicle load.</p>
                         
                        <h3>While inspecting your brakes, we check the following:</h3>

                         <li>- BRAKE/HYDRAULIC FLUID (LEVEL AND CONDITION)</li>
                         <li>- BRAKE HOSES–THESE WEAR OUT OFTEN, AND NEED TO BE CHECKED REGULARLY FOR WEAR AND TEAR</li>
