            <h3>The Common Problem</h3>
            <p>Your engine is truly a feat of manufacturing and is made of hundreds of high-temperature moving parts and 
                electrical systems alongside complex mechanical components. <br> It’s easy to pay no mind to your engine, but it 
                is what allows you to get from point A to point B reliably–which is precisely why you shouldn’t ignore the 
                upkeep and maintenance of your engine. <br><br>

                <b>Pro Tip</b>: The most common sign of an engine in need of service is an oil leak. If you notice oil leaking 
                underneath your car, it’s best to bring it in for service immediately. <br> Typically oil leaks are the result of
                 neglected maintenance, as seals become hardened and dry and can no longer protect against fluid loss.</p>
                 <p>When it comes to engine service, the most common long-term maintenance we perform is replacing the timing components. In simple terms, your timing system ensures that your engine’s valves open and close at the right time. Over time, these components wear down or begin to fail.</p>

                 <h3>Regular Engine Maintenance</h3>
                 <p>Engine maintenance typically includes the following to help prolong the life of your engine:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>- SPARK PLUG REPLACEMENT</li>
                     <li>- SPARK PLUG WIRE INSPECTION</li>
                     <li>- A THOROUGH INSPECTION OF ALL ENGINE COMPONENTS</li>
