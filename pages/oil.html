               <h1>Oil And Filter Changes</h1>
               <p>Your vehicle is one of the biggest and most important investments that you’ll make. Most people are constantly looking for ways to prolong the life of their car or truck, to ensure they have reliable transportation to get where they need to go. But did you know that the easiest, most effective way to preserve the life of your vehicle without spending a ton of money is to get your oil and oil filter changed regularly?</p>
               <br>
               <p>Many people are guilty of putting off oil changes because they don’t seem like a big deal, but clean oil and oil filters are essential in maintaining a healthy engine. Oil lubricates the multitude of moving parts within your engine, allowing it to run smoothly. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes gummy or watery, and doesn’t work as well. If left unchanged, old oil can cause expensive and inconvenient engine problems</p>
               <h2>How Regular Oil Changes Benefit Your Vehicle:</h2>
               <p>Oil helps lubricate and cool the various parts of your engine, while reducing friction, diminishing wear, and forming a seal between the pistons, rings, and cylinder walls. Without the cleaning power of new oil, carbon and particle buildup become toxic to the engine. This is why we recommend that you follow the interval as suggested by your most recent oil change (the earlier of the two limits from the sticker on your windshield). <br>  Getting regular oil and filter changes is a small price to pay to avoid expensive engine repair or breakdown.</p>

                    <p>Synthetic motor oil is manufactured entirely in a factory, or lab. Because of this, they tend to be far more consistent; it’s easier to control manufacturing processes when all of your materials are held to much more stringent standards. Thus, these oils are more refined, and are overall better for your engine</p>
                    <p>But this comes at a cost—literally. Full-synthetic motor oil is more expensive than conventional oil. Not by a lot, mind you, but generally you can expect to pay anywhere from an extra $20 to $40 for your oil change if you use a full-synthetic oil, depending on how much your car takes. Synthetic oils also tend to last longer, going for longer periods of time and distance than conventional oils do before needing to be changed.</p>

                    <h2>Conventional Oil</h2>
                   <p>Conventional oil is your standard motor oil. It’s manufactured from crude oil that’s pulled from the ground and then refined in a factory. Different additives and processes are done to improve its viscosity (thickness) and engine protective properties, and it’s then bottled and sold for use in your engine. Simple as that.</p>
                    <p>There are up and downsides to this. The biggest upside: cost. Conventional oil is an extremely budget-friendly option for keeping your engine protected and your car running smoothly. It’s also fairly effective—there aren’t really any bad motor oils on the market these days; as long as you get the right weight and quantity, you can expect reasonable performance. However, their downsides are greater than other types. Because of the naturally-occurring materials, they tend to be less refined. They also offer a lower degree of protection than other types as well.</p>
